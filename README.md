<b>Google App Script: Task Management</b>
 
<b>Project Description</b>

Custom Task Menu with Submenus:

I have created a custom menu within your Google Sheets or Google Workspace application.
This menu includes submenus such as "Create Task," "Task Status," and "Select All Tasks."

Task Listing:

The "Create Task" submenu allows users to add new tasks. This likely involves a form or prompt for users to input task details.

The "Task Status" submenu likely displays a list of tasks along with their current statuses. Users can view and manage the status of existing tasks from here.

The "Select All Tasks" submenu provides a way to select multiple tasks at once, streamlining the task management process.
Task Assignment:

You've implemented functionality to assign tasks to specific employees. This involves updating the task status on the server to reflect the assignment.

Task Status Update:

When tasks are assigned to employees, the status of these tasks is updated on the server. This ensures that the system accurately reflects the current state of each task.

Task Progress Display:

You've added a feature to display task progress. This could involve showing a progress bar, percentage completion, or other indicators that provide users with insights into the status of ongoing tasks.
